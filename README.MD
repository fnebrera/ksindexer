# KsIndexer

KsIndexer is a desktop tool to store documents, related metadata, (optional) original hardwriten image and an (optional) set
of attached files in a local database that can be searched using different criteria.

KsIndexer is specially well suited for storing notes or notebooks imported from electronic-ink devices like Kindle Scribe&trade;
or Remarkable&trade;. Those devices allow to convert handwritten notes to TXT files using sophisticated OCR technologies.
Using simple handrwitten symbols while taking a note for a meeting or just thinking on an idea helps KsIdexer to identify
metadada like Title, Date, Attendantds, Keywords, etc. and store them in the database together the converted notebook text
and original raster image (PDF file).

KsIndexder shows the current document in a compact view that allows to see the original image, the converted text and the
metadata in a single window, with simple controls for accessing and editing every piece of document content.

KsIndexer allows for complex searches using different criteria like date ranges, keywords, title content, meeting attendants, etc.

Stored documents can be printed or exported to HTML of TXT formats.
